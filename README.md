MazeSolver is a 2D Maze Solver built in C# using Windows Forms. The application generates a random maze and visually demonstrates the solving process using three different search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A*. 
It features an interactive control panel that allows users to select the algorithm, maze size, and delay per step so that the search process is clearly animated.
